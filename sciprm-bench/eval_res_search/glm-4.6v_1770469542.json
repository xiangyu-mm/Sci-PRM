The paper specifically examines reconstruction skill of oceanic precipitation and explicitly discusses how skill decreases with distance from land observations, which directly addresses the visible pattern mentioned in the question. The paper's content aligns perfectly with the described analysis showing higher skill near land and lower skill in remote oceanic areas."
