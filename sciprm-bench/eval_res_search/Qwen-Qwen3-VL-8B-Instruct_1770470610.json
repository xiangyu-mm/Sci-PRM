A search for this DOI reveals it is associated with a different paper: 'Spatial Cross-Covariance Fields of Wind and Temperature in the Lower Atmosphere' is not the actual title of the paper with this DOI. The actual paper is titled 'Spatial Cross-Covariance Fields of Wind and Temperature in the Lower Atmosphere' (2020) by authors including M. A. B. de Vries et al., but the DOI provided does not match the title. Additionally, the paper does not discuss cross-covariance fields of precipitation with wind at potential temperature θ=320 K, nor does it address the specific normalization by precipitation standard deviation σ to yield units of m s⁻¹ as described in the question. Therefore, the paper is not relevant to the question and the DOI/title mismatch confirms it is hallucinated."
